Search algorithm is an [[Algorithm In General|algorithm]] designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms works to retrieve information stored within particular [[Data Structure In General|data structure]], or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values. 

The appropriate search algorithm often **depends on the data structure being searched**, and may also **include prior knowledge about the data**. Search algorithms can be made faster or more efficient by specially constructed database structures, such as search trees, hash maps, and database indexes.

Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types of algorithms: [[Linear Search|linear]], [[Binary Search|binary]], and [[Hash Table|hashing]].
