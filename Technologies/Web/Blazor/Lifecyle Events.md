there are several lifecycle events that a component can handle during its lifetime. These events include:

1. **OnInitialized**: This event is triggered when the component is initialized, but before it has received any data from its parent component.
2. **OnParametersSet**: This event is triggered after the component has received data from its parent component, but before it has rendered.
3. **OnAfterRender**: This event is triggered after the component has rendered, but before any child components have rendered.
4. **OnAfterRenderAsync**: This event is similar to _OnAfterRender_, but it allows you to perform asynchronous operations before the child components are rendered.
5. **OnUpdate**: This event is triggered whenever the component's parameters are updated, but before the component is re-rendered.
6. **OnDispose**: This event is triggered when the component is being disposed of, typically when it is being removed from the DOM
