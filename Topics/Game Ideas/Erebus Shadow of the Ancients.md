Act I:

The Forgotten One begins their journey as a lone adventurer, drawn to the remote and desolate region of Erebus that was once home to a great civilization. As they explore the abandoned ruins and ancient temples scattered throughout the world, they uncover clues and hints about what happened to the civilization and begin to piece together the story of its demise. As they explore the ancient ruins, they come across various artifacts and relics that provide insight into the history of the civilization, such as old scrolls and inscriptions on the walls of temples.

As The Forgotten One continues their journey through Erebus, they encounter various challenges and obstacles that test their skills and determination. They may come across puzzles to solve, traps to avoid, and enemies to defeat as they explore the ruins and ancient temples. Along the way, they may encounter other travelers and adventurers who are also searching for clues about the civilization's demise, and they may form alliances or rivalries with them as they try to outdo each other in their quest for knowledge.

As The Forgotten One gathers more information about the civilization and its downfall in Erebus, they begin to form theories and hypotheses about what caused the disaster that wiped out the civilization. They may encounter conflicting information and conflicting theories, and must decide for themselves what they believe to be true. As they draw closer to the truth, they begin to realize that they are not the only ones searching for answers, and that they may be in danger from those who would do anything to keep the truth hidden.
