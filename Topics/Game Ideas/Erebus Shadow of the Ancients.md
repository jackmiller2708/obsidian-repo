The player takes on the role of a lone adventurer who is drawn to a remote, desolate region of the world that was once home to a great civilization. As the player explores the abandoned ruins and ancient temples scattered throughout the world, they uncover clues and hints about what happened to the civilization, and begin to piece together the story of its demise.

As they delve deeper into the mystery, the player discovers that the civilization was destroyed by a great disaster, caused by a powerful, ancient artifact that had been buried beneath the earth for centuries. The artifact, which was believed to be a source of great power and knowledge, had been discovered and unearthed by a group of researchers and adventurers, who were seeking to unlock its secrets. However, as they delved deeper into its mysteries, they were consumed by its power, turning them into corrupt, twisted beings that were obsessed with harnessing the artifact's power for their own ends.

The player soon discovers that the artifact is a powerful crystal known as “The Eye of Eltar”. It is believed that this crystal possesses some kind of consciousness, and can manipulate people's minds and actions. The ancient civilization was destroyed because their leaders fell under its influence, turning them into evil beings who were obsessed with controlling the world around them. The player must find a way to stop the Eye of Eltar from corrupting their mind and destroying them as well. After each boss fight, the player would gain some of the power from the fragments of the Eye.
